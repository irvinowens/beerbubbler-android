# beerbubbler-android

This is the companion application to the [Beer Bubbler](https://github.com/irvinowens/beerbubbler) project, which will
allow you to attach a raspberry pi and sense-hat to your Carboy, then run the application there to gather statistics
like humidity, temperature and vibration for determining when your beer is most likely ready and you should take your
remaining specific gravity measurements.
